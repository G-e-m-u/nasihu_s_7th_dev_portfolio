This creates a simple CSS animation where a moon continuously orbits around an earth at the center of the screen.

The page centers a circular “space” container on a dark background. Inside it, a blue circle represents Earth, fixed in the middle. 
Around it is an invisible circular orbit that rotates using a CSS keyframe animation. 
A smaller gray circle (the Moon) is positioned at the top of this orbit, and as the orbit rotates,
the Moon appears to revolve smoothly around Earth in a continuous loop.
